## Contribute
- Refer the documentation for [bootstrap LESS drupal project](https://github.com/drupalprojects/bootstrap/tree/8.x-3.x/starterkits/less).
- Read up on how to use the Less CSS pre-processor and [less compiler](http://lesscss.org/).
- Download the latest [bootstrap less source code](http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)
- In your drupal installation, `cd` into themes directory.
- Then, `git clone git@github.com:UIS-CSClub/csclubstrap.git`
- Also download and extract the [base theme](https://www.drupal.org/project/bootstrap) into themes directory.
- Extract bootstrap-x.x folder (downloaded in step 3) into the root of this theme and rename it to "bootstrap".
- Before enabling the theme, you need to get few modules.
- You need to `cd` into modules directory of your drupal installation, then `git clone git@github.com:UIS-CSClub/custom-modules.git custom`. It will clone all the modules present in the custom-modules repository into the custom folder.
- You also need to get [twitter block](https://www.drupal.org/project/twitter_block) and extract it in modules directory.
- *Install modules first and then install (& enable) the theme so that it places the blocks automatically.*
- Enable the twig debugger in drupal.
